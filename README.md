# Kaggle_Digit_Recognizer
ConvNet and PCA/SVM approaches to the kaggle digit recognizer challenge

First approach uses a nonlinear SVM (ovo-shape) on the first 100 PCA components, done in Python with SciKitLearn (91% accuracy)

The second approach implements a Convolutional Neural Network with two hidden layers, done in Python with Tensorflow (99% accuracy)
